# B2W Challenge

### Mission

Develop a Twitter's clone timeline.

### Report:

Unfortunatelly I don't have the able time to finish the challenge on the deadline (personal problems :()

But, even knowing i'll not be approved, my code is on the repo on the step I've stopped.

I've did my best :D

### To run:

```
 $ npm run start
 # or
 $ yarn start
```

### Tests(Only if you really want it. `start` already runs it.):

 $ npm run test
 # or
 $ yarn test
